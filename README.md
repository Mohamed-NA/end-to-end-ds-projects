# End-to-End Data Science Projects ðŸš€

This repository showcases a complete journey through **real-world data science workflows**, covering everything from data cleaning and analysis to machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.

> Each project reflects a hands-on challenge I tackled.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering**
Analyzed multiple datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers using:
- `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `plotly`
- Feature engineering techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

### 2. **Web Scraping & Data Automation**
Built a scraper that extracts structured information from a books website and exports results into Excel using:
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `Requests`
- `pandas`

### 3. **Machine Learning Models**
Applied multiple ML models on both classification and regression datasets:
- Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, RMSE, Confusion Matrix

### 4. **Deep Learning for Classification**
Built and trained deep neural networks using `TensorFlow` to classify binary data effectively. Focus on:
- Data normalization
- Model architecture and tuning
- Overfitting handling with dropout and regularization

### 5. **Medical AI Chatbot (GenAI + Memory)**
Developed a simple medical chatbot that:
- Takes patient complaints
- Infers the appropriate medical specialty
- Suggests available doctors
Built using:
- Google Gemini API
- LangChain memory
- Python + prompt engineering

## âš™ Automation Projects

### 6. **File Sorting & Timestamp Automation**
Python script that automatically:
- Scans a directory
- Extracts file creation dates
- Sorts and copies files into folders by month/year  
> Used `os`, `datetime`, `shutil`, and platform-aware logic.

### 7. **Web Login Automation (Playwright)**
Automated login process using `Playwright`:
- Headless browser handling
- Filling forms, handling buttons, and waits
- Basic validation and error handling

### 8. **Excel Automation with Python**
Manipulates Excel sheets to:
- Clean, filter, and reorganize data
- Export reports or summaries automatically  
> Leveraged `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and `xlsxwriter`.

> All automation tasks are found in the `/Automation` folder.
